<h1>Target Audience</h1>
<p>The target audience is going to be for people wanting to be healthy and also people who want fruity sweet flavors</p>
<p>For healthy options there will be a display of nutrition for people. With different macros and a list of healthy options.</p>
<p>These people will be fitness enthusiasts or people who want fruit drinks but also want to watch their weight.</p>
<p>The other side of people are the ones who don't care about nutrition but want to have a good drink and don't care about sugar</p>
<p>Sugar drinks will have fun names and be on display and so people who aren't looking for nutrition will want these options</p>
