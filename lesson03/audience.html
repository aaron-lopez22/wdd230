          <p>This is a new business owner who has a great idea and wants to build his store but lacks knowledge on business.
             He is looking for a way to start his company strong. He wants to find the information he needs in one place and wants to connect and find his best resources.</p>
             <p>This is someone who is young and has little to no schooling on being an Entrepreneur but is willing to learn and look for the means necessary to succeed.</p>
             <h2>Already Established</h2>
             <p>Name: Cynthia</p>

             <P>Will use tablet and mobile for website</P>
             <p>Cynthia is already an established store. The reason Cynthia would come to the site is for more resources to grow. 
                The store has been stagnant so she wants new resources like networking. She wants to connect with others and see what methods they used.</p>
                <p>She has schooling and has done great so far. She is familiar with business side of things here but needs just a few more things for her store to grow.</p>
